# (Circle Area, Diameter and Circumference) For a circle of radius 2, display the diameter,
# circumference and area. Use the value 3.14159 for π. Use the following formulas
# (r is the radius): diameter = 2r, circumference = 2πr and area = πr2. [In a later chapter, we’ll
# introduce Python’s math module which contains a higher-precision representation of π.]


pi = 3.14159
radius = 2
diameter = 2 * radius
circumference = 2 * pi * radius
area = pi * radius ** 2

print ('diameter =', diameter)
print ('circumference =',circumference)
print ('area =', area)
